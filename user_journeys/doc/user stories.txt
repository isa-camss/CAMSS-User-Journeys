USER STORY 1
I, as a procurer, want to obtain the interoperability specifications catalogued by CAMSS and their assessments, so I can mention the specifications I am interested in my procurement procedure.


UC Title: Interoperability Specifications Catalog
Actor: procurer
flow: Get the list of specifications through CAMSS hub
alternative flow: 
    Get the list of the specifications linked to the assessment
    Get the assessments for one specification
    Get the CAV dataset of the assessment
    Get the CSSV dataset of the specification

PROCURER_USE_CASES = [
    {'name': 'UC-1',
     'title': '<strong>SPECIFICATIONS CATALOG</strong>',
     'query_value': sparql.QUERY_ALL_SPECIFICATIONS_ASSESSED,
     'description': '''This SPARQL query returns the interoperability specifications catalog by CAMSS and their 
      assessments. You can also modify the query if you need to complement it.<br>Press the Run button to execute it.'''},
